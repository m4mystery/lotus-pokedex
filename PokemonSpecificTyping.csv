It's more like a sparrow or chickadee (this link is further solidified by Pidgey having the shortest cry in the game). The link to pigeons exists behavior (sense of direction), as Pidgey are used as messenger birds much like pigeons (anime ep.164 Carrying On, National Pidgey Mail Service in Johto (Goldenrod), Sinnoh (Jubilife City), Kanto (Saffron City), Hoenn (Lilycove City), and Unova (Castelia City)).<br/> Pidgey's natural predator is Ekans."

If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Despite the name inferring that it's part of a Pigeon line, the design is more akin to that of an Osprey (a bird of prey). This Pokémon's etymology is deeply routed in the original game. Pidgeotto is a portmanteau of Pigeon and Diciotto (Italian for 18), Pidgey's level requirement to evolve in the mainline games."

This Pokemon's name and pronunciation differ, unlike the pre-evolutions. Despite Ash calling this Pokémon Pid-gee-oht, the proper pronunciation of this Pokémon is actually Pid-jet, as the name is a portmanteau of Pigeon and Jet. This original pronunciation is heard in the PokéRap.<br/>Pidgeot's design takes inspiration from the Golden Eagle, a link strengthened by it's Shiny form. The design also has Egyptian origin, as the eye markings and head design seem to be derived from the Gods Ra and Horus."

Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> The name Ekans is Snake backwards. They are Pidgey's natural preditor.<br/>Ekan's design is a combination of rattlesnake (tail), facial marking of an indian cobra, with bands reminiscent to Diadophis punctatus or ringneck snake. The final design element could be inspired by the mythological creature Basilisk, as the Ekans line are poison type and can learn glare. Archbishop Isidore of Seville described the Basilisk as a creature with 'the king of snakes, due to its killing glare and its poisonous breath'."
24,Arbok,Poison,,438,60,85,69,65,79,80,1,FALSE,,,Ekans>Arbok,Cobra,"This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace is impossible.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Arbok mirrored backwords is Kobra.

When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> The name is a portmanteau of the Japanese borrowed word for Needle - ニドル (Nedoru), cnidocyte (thing in all poisonous animals) and rhino. Finally, 二度 or Nido in Japanese can be translated to 'two times' and this is often attributed to the Nidoran line splitting into male and female.<br/><br/><b>Gender Differences:</b> Females in Nidoran family are light blue.

This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> The name is a portmanteau of the Japanese borrowed word for Needle - ニドル (Nedoru), cnidocyte (thing in all poisonous animals) and rhino. The rina aspect is attributed to European languages like Italian or Spanish where a denotes female names."
31,Nidoqueen,Poison,Ground,505,90,92,87,75,85,76,1,FALSE,,,Nidoran F>Nidorina>Nidoqueen,Drill,"Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales.

It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Clefable is unofically referred to as an Extraterrestrial Pokémon.

The tail separates into six if this Pokémon receives plenty of love from its Trainer. The six tails become magnificently curled.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Vulpix is a portmanteau of vulpine (something that resembles a fox), and six (number of tails it has). Vulpix is derived from Japanese folklore of a Kitsune 狐, which can be translated as fox or conversely, demon fox. The number of tails it has denotes how powerful the spirit is."

The more fertile the soil, the glossier its leaves become.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Oddish has a fascinating branching evolution line, and my hunch is that is based on whether it fights off or doesn't fight off a parasitic infection that this Pokémon is susceptible to."

Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Gloom is based on the plant Rafflesia arnoldii a.k.a. the 'Stinking Corpse lily'. The plant got it's name because it smells like rotting flesh. Rafflesia is a parasite and it infects the plant host where a bud emerges. This has uncanny parallels to what happened to Oddish. The red discoloration of the leaves on it's head are also reminiscent to when plants are not getting nutrients, and this is because the parasite is leeching from the host Oddish. I suspect that the infected Oddish, Gloom, has two evolution lines because one is a scenario where the host cannot battle the infection, keeping it's susceptibility to spread the Parasite (Vileplume), and a line that was able to combat the Parasite and the healthy Oddish evolves to what it actually should have evolved into (Bellossom).<br/>Female Gloom have one large spot per bud, whilst males are covered in spots."

They are used to attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Vileplume is based on the plant Rafflesia arnoldii a.k.a. the 'Stinking Corpse lily'. The plant got it's name because it smells like rotting flesh. This is the final stage of the Parasite as it has now fully integrated itself with the host Oddish, the evolution line where the inverse is true is Bellossom.<br/><br/><b>Gender Differences:</b> Female's petals have larger spots."

They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Paras' name is derived from Parasite. The fungus on its back is inspired by the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, more commonly known as the Cordyceps. This fungus takes over the host, slowly growing to the brain, where the host slowly starts to lose themselves and act according to the needs of the Parasite. The Cordyceps virus has medicinal potential in humans as it contains immunomodulatory, antiinfective, and anticancer agents."

When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Parasect is a portmanteau of Parasite and Insect. The Cordyceps like fungus that it contracted as a Paras has fully taken over it's body, as can be seen by it's lifeless eyes. This host creature is no longer be seen as alive, and is merely a shell / puppet controlled by the virus. A similar concept can be seen in the video game the 'Last of Us'."

For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Meowth is based off a 招き猫 (Makineko) or 'beckoning cat'. They are believed to be a good luck charm. This connection is further strengthened by the 小判 (Koban) coin it has on its forhead. This Edo/Tokugawa period (1603–1868) coin is thought to bring good fortune."

This discovery spurred controversy among scholars. If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can’t remember having done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep.<br/><br/><b>Prof. Lotus' Notes:</b> Despite the Psy- prefix in the name coming from Psychic, Psyduck is not a has no Psychic partial typing.
